## Problem Description

A major city has a complex public transportation system, consisting of multiple stations and routes connecting them. Each route has a specific travel time. The goal is to help passengers find the **fastest route** from one station to another.

### Solution Using Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra’s algorithm is an efficient method to find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a **non-negative weighted graph**.

**Steps:**

1. Initialize the distance to all nodes as infinity, except the start node (set to 0).
2. Use a **priority queue (min-heap)** to always expand the node with the smallest known distance.
3. For each neighbor of the current node, update its distance if a shorter path is found.
4. Repeat until all nodes have been processed.

## Summary

- **Graph Modeling**
  - **Nodes (Vertices):** Represent transportation stations.
  - **Edges:** Represent direct connections between stations.
  - **Weights:** Represent travel times between stations.

- **Algorithm Used**
  - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** is used for computing the shortest paths in a **weighted, directed graph** with non-negative weights.

- **Why Dijkstra?**
  - Efficient for real-time pathfinding in graphs with positive weights.
  - Widely used in routing and GPS navigation systems.

- **Implementation Details**
  - Utilizes a **priority queue (min-heap)** to select the next node with the smallest known distance.
  - Maintains a dictionary to track the shortest known distance to each node.
  - Updates neighbor distances if a shorter path is discovered.
