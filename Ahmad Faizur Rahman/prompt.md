## Q :


DESC:
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

How to approach this problem?

## A: 

Okay, this problem is about converting a binary tree into a string and then back again. The trick is to do it in a way that preserves the structure of the tree, including all the None (null) children, or else you can’t rebuild it exactly. Here's the logic part you need to understand before even touching code:
***

### Serialization Logic (Tree → String)
Imagine you're walking through the tree in preorder (visit root → left → right), and:
* Every time you hit a node, you record its value.
* you hit a `None` (a missing left or right child), you write `"null"` (or some other marker).
* Join all the values with commas to make a single string.

Example: Tree
```clojure
    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5
```
Preorder with nulls: `1,2,null,null,3,4,null,null,5,null,null`  
Why this works: You’re capturing not just values, but also where values are missing. That’s what makes it possible to reconstruct the exact tree later.   
***

### Deserialization Logic (String → Tree)
Now, you split the string by commas and use the values like a queue:

* Take the first value, make it a `TreeNode`.
* Then do the same recursively for the left and right children
* If you see `"null"`, just return `None` (that’s your base case)  

This logic mirrors the preorder traversal:
* Create node → build left subtree → build right subtree

***

### Summary

You:
* Use preorder traversal and include `"null"`s to serialize
* Use recursive DFS and consume the values in order to deserialize

That's the full idea. No fancy data structures needed—just a string, a queue (or iterator), and recursion. You ready to implement it or wanna walk through an example more slowly?
