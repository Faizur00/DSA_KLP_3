## Q :


DESC:
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

How to approach this problem?

## A: 

## ü™Ñ Step-by-Step Logic to Approach Serialization and Deserialization

### 1. Understand What Needs to Be Captured
You need to record:
- Each node‚Äôs value
- The structure (i.e., which node is left or right of another, and where it's null)

Just values aren‚Äôt enough. For example, trees `[1,2,null]` and `[1,null,2]` have same values, but totally different structure.

### 2. Choose a Tree Traversal Strategy
You can pick one of these:
- **Preorder (Root ‚Üí Left ‚Üí Right)** ‚Üí super popular for this use-case
- **Level-order (BFS)** ‚Üí nice because it reflects structure more naturally like rows

Let‚Äôs focus on **Preorder traversal** first‚Äîit‚Äôs clean and intuitive.

### 3. Serialize (Tree ‚ûù String)
Use recursion or stack to:
- Visit node
- Write value to string
- If node is null, write some marker like `#` or `null`

**Example using Preorder:**

Tree:
```
   1
  / \
 2   3
    / \
   4   5
```

Serialized string: `"1,2,#,#,3,4,#,#,5,#,#"`  
(Each `#` is for null left/right child)

### 4. Deserialize (String ‚ûù Tree)
You reverse the process:
- Read values from the string (split by commas)
- Rebuild tree recursively in the same traversal order (e.g., preorder)
- When value is `#`, return null and move on

Use an index or a queue to track your position in the value list while deserializing.

### 5. Alternative Option ‚Äì Level Order (BFS)
This works too:
- Use a queue, go level by level
- Serialize with `null`s where child is missing
- Deserialize by assigning children using a queue again

It may be a bit more memory-heavy but sometimes easier to visualize

## ‚úß Summary of Choices

| Strategy     | Pros                        | Cons                      |
|--------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Preorder     | Simple recursion, elegant   | Might be tricky for big trees |
| Level Order  | Matches how LeetCode does   | Slightly more verbose     |
